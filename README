* Introduction
Asyncronous Reliable Extensible Scheme Network REPL and Guile
imlementation of [[https://nrepl.org/nrepl/index.html][NREPL]] protocol.

* Open Questions
- How to work with fibers in nrepl?  Maybe C-2 C-c C-e to entered to
  the clonned session with fibers spawned.

* Other REPLs Quirks
One of the reasons this project started is unfortunate missbehave of
current REPL soultions in different situation and here is a list of
some of them:
- call/cc works when pasted into prompt of the repl, but fails when
  evaling from buffer with C-x C-e.
- It's not possible to interrupt evaluation if geiser-connect is used.
- It's not possible to see stdout until evaluation completed.
- Gider tests hangs repl on errors.
- CAPF function is injected, even if there is no connection to REPL
  and throws errors preventing other CAPFs to work.
- There is no way to provide stdin input to running expression.
